        <p>This website is a collection of shared knowledge throughout the years for designated courses
            wherever resources are available. Some of them are made by me, some by others or a complete collabaration
            of knowledge being shared by students. <br>
            <br>
            At the moment this website mainly contains a large collection of knowledge over the A.I course.
